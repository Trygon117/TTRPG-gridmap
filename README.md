# About this project
This was a fun project I was working on that allows the user to make a 3d map. The idea is that people could make a tile based map for games like Dungeons and Dragons so people could play together online. In the end it's just a technical demonstration about how I could use three.js to achieve that goal and I never actually finished it.
